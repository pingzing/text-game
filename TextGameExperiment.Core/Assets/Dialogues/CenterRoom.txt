$(title)CANDLELIT ROOM$(title)$(chartime 30)You round the bend to find...

...holy $(pause 500)$(str)shit.$(str)

It's a stone altar surrounded by taper candles, thickly encrusted in wax. The whole ensemble is surrounded by an iron pentagram anchored to the stone floor of the cavern.

The candles look like they were lit recently. There aren't many fresh dribbles.

You can return to the entrance. Maybe...maybe you should do that.
